# Pit: Pre-trade Integrity Toolkit

![Pit](doc/assets/pit-readme-banner.png)

Pit is a workspace for embeddable pre-trade risk components.

The project is built around a simple idea: before an order reaches a venue, it
should pass through a deterministic risk pipeline that can reject, reserve
state, and later absorb post-trade outcomes back into the same control system.

## How The Flow Works

1. The engine is configured once during platform initialization.
2. Each order first goes through lightweight start-stage checks. This stage is
   meant for fast decisions and for controls that must observe every request,
   even when the order is rejected early.
3. If the order passes the start stage, the caller receives a deferred request
   object. That object represents the heavier pre-trade stage, but the heavy
   checks have not run yet.
4. When the deferred request is executed, the engine runs the main-stage risk
   policies and collects all registered mutations. If the stage fails, the
   collected state is rolled back. If it succeeds, the caller receives a
   reservation.
5. The reservation must then be finalized explicitly. Commit keeps the reserved
   state. Rollback cancels it. Dropping the reservation without finalization
   rolls it back automatically.
6. After execution, post-trade reports are fed back into the engine so that
   policies depending on realized outcomes can update their internal state.

## Current Scope

The current implementation focuses on the pre-trade pipeline and a set of
foundational controls:

- P&L kill switch
- sliding-window rate limit
- per-settlement order size limits

The engine is intentionally in-memory and deterministic. It is designed to be
embedded into a larger trading system rather than replace one.

## Where To Start

[The `openpit` crate README](crates/openpit/README.md) if you want to start
with the Rust interface and a runnable example.

[The Python bindings README](bindings/python/README.md) if you want to work
with Pit from Python via the `openpit` package.

## Local Build And Test

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain
- Python `>=3.9`
- `maturin` for Python bindings build
- `pytest` for Python tests

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Build

#### SDK

With [Just](https://just.systems/):

```bash
just build
```

Manual:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

#### Python

With [Just](https://just.systems/):

```bash
just python-develop
just python-develop-release
```

Manual:

```bash
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
maturin develop --release --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
```

The recommended Python test flow is to run `maturin develop` before `pytest`.
This runs against the current checkout (including a dirty worktree). If sources
did not change, Cargo can reuse cached artifacts and avoid a full rebuild.

### Tests

With [Just](https://just.systems/):

```bash
# All tests:
just test-all

# Rust:
just test-rust

# Python:
just test-python
just test-python-unit
just test-python-integration
```

Manual:

```bash
# All tests:
cargo test --workspace
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests

# Rust:
cargo test --workspace

# Python
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests/unit
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests/integration
```

// DryRunPolicy is an optional interface that a Policy implementation may
// satisfy to provide explicit read-only dry-run hooks.
//
// When a policy that implements DryRunPolicy is registered, the engine calls
// the dry-run methods instead of the normal ones for non-mutating dry-run
// paths, so the policy can report what would happen without spending budget,
// applying holds, or producing any other side effect.
//
// A policy that mutates engine state in CheckPreTradeStart or
// PerformPreTradeCheck (for example, a rate limiter that spends budget) MUST
// implement DryRunPolicy with read-only variants. If DryRunPolicy is not
// implemented, the engine delegates to the normal hooks for the dry-run path,
// which will cause those side effects to happen during a dry-run.
//
// The method signatures mirror CheckPreTradeStart and PerformPreTradeCheck on
// Policy exactly; only the semantics differ (no mutations, no side effects).

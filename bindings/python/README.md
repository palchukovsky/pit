# Pit (Pre-trade Integrity Toolkit) for Python

`openpit` is an embeddable pre-trade risk SDK for integrating policy-driven
risk checks into trading systems from Python.

For full project documentation, see
[the repository README](https://github.com/openpitkit/pit/blob/main/README.md).
For conceptual and architectural pages, see
[the project wiki](https://github.com/openpitkit/pit/wiki).

## Install

For normal end-user installation, use the published
[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/openpit/):

```bash
pip install openpit
```

If you need local development/debugging, clone this repository and build from
source with [Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin):

```bash
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
```

Local release build:

```bash
maturin develop --release --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
```

## Engine

### Overview

The engine evaluates an order through a deterministic pre-trade pipeline:

- `engine.start_pre_trade(order=...)` runs start-stage policies and makes
  lightweight check policies
- `request.execute()` runs main-stage check policies
- `reservation.commit()` applies reserved state
- `reservation.rollback()` reverts reserved state
- `engine.apply_execution_report(report=...)` updates post-trade policy state

Start-stage policies stop on the first reject. Main-stage policies aggregate
rejects and run rollback mutations in reverse order when any reject is produced.

Built-in policies currently include:

- `OrderValidationPolicy`
- `PnlKillSwitchPolicy`
- `RateLimitPolicy`
- `OrderSizeLimitPolicy`

There are two types of rejections: a full kill switch for the account and a
rejection of only the current request. This is useful in algorithmic trading
when automatic order submission must be halted until the situation is analyzed.

## Usage

```python
import openpit

# 1. Configure policies.
pnl = openpit.pretrade.policies.PnlKillSwitchPolicy(
    settlement_asset="USD",
    barrier="1000",
)

rate_limit = openpit.pretrade.policies.RateLimitPolicy(
    max_orders=100,
    window_seconds=1,
)

size = openpit.pretrade.policies.OrderSizeLimitPolicy(
    limit=openpit.pretrade.policies.OrderSizeLimit(
        settlement_asset="USD",
        max_quantity="500",
        max_notional="100000",
    ),
)

# 2. Build the engine (one time at the platform initialization).
engine = (
    openpit.Engine.builder()
    .check_pre_trade_start_policy(
        policy=openpit.pretrade.policies.OrderValidationPolicy(),
    )
    .check_pre_trade_start_policy(policy=pnl)
    .check_pre_trade_start_policy(policy=rate_limit)
    .check_pre_trade_start_policy(policy=size)
    .build()
)

# 3. Check an order.
order = openpit.Order(
    underlying_asset="AAPL",
    settlement_asset="USD",
    side="buy",
    quantity=100.0,
    price=185.0,
)

start_result = engine.start_pre_trade(order=order)

if not start_result:
    reject = start_result.reject
    raise RuntimeError(
        f"{reject.policy} [{reject.code}]: {reject.reason}: {reject.details}"
    )

request = start_result.request

# 4. Quick, lightweight checks, such as fat-finger scope or enabled kill
# switch, were performed during pre-trade request creation. The system state
# has not yet changed, except in cases where each request, even rejected ones,
# must be considered. Before the heavy-duty checks, other work on the request
# can be performed simply by holding the request object.

# 5. Real pre-trade and risk control.
execute_result = request.execute()

if not execute_result:
    messages = ", ".join(
        f"{reject.policy} [{reject.code}]: {reject.reason}: {reject.details}"
        for reject in execute_result.rejects
    )
    raise RuntimeError(messages)

reservation = execute_result.reservation

# 6. If the request is successfully sent to the venue, it must be committed.
# The rollback must be called otherwise to revert all performed reservations.
try:
    send_order_to_venue(order)
except Exception:
    reservation.rollback()
    raise

reservation.commit()

# 7. The order goes to the venue and returns with an execution report.
report = openpit.pretrade.ExecutionReport(
    underlying_asset="AAPL",
    settlement_asset="USD",
    pnl=-50.0,
    fee=3.4,
)

result = engine.apply_execution_report(report=report)

# 8. After each execution report is applied, the system may report that it has
# been determined in advance that all subsequent requests will be rejected if
# the account status does not change.
assert result.kill_switch_triggered is False
```

## Errors

Policy rejects from `engine.start_pre_trade()` and `request.execute()` are
returned as `StartPreTradeResult` and `ExecuteResult`.

Input validation errors and API misuse still raise exceptions:

- `ValueError` for invalid assets/sides/malformed numeric inputs
- `RuntimeError` for lifecycle misuse, for example executing the same request
  twice or finalizing the same reservation twice

## Local Testing

Recommended local flow:

```bash
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests
```

Run only unit tests:

```bash
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests/unit
```

Run only integration test:

```bash
maturin develop --manifest-path bindings/python/Cargo.toml
python -m pytest bindings/python/tests/integration
```

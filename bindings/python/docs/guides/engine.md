# Engine lifecycle

The engine owns the policy instances registered by the builder. Build one engine
per independent risk-control state and choose the synchronization policy that
matches the host's call pattern.

## Build an engine

```python
import openpit
import openpit.pretrade.policies

engine = (
    openpit.Engine.builder()
    .with_local_sync()
    .builtin(
        openpit.pretrade.policies.build_order_validation(),
    )
    .pre_trade_policy(policy=MyMainStagePolicy())
    .account_adjustment_policy(policy=MyAccountAdjustmentPolicy())
    .build()
)
```

Policy names must be unique within one engine configuration for start-stage and
main-stage pre-trade policies.

Use `with_full_sync()` when the same engine is called concurrently from multiple
OS threads. Use `with_account_sync()` only when calls are serialized on one
engine handle and each account is pinned to one processing chain.

## Run the explicit two-stage flow

```python
start_result = engine.start_pre_trade(order=order)
if not start_result:
    messages = ", ".join(
        f"{reject.policy} [{reject.code}]: {reject.reason}"
        for reject in start_result.rejects
    )
    raise RuntimeError(messages)
else:
    execute_result = start_result.request.execute()
```

Use the explicit flow when there is useful work between the lightweight start
stage and the heavier main stage.

## Run the shortcut flow

```python
execute_result = engine.execute_pre_trade(order=order)
```

The shortcut returns the same `ExecuteResult` shape as `request.execute()`. It
can contain start-stage rejects or main-stage rejects.

## Finalize reservations

```python
def send_order(order: openpit.Order) -> None:
    _ = order


if execute_result:
    reservation = execute_result.reservation
    try:
        send_order(order)
    except Exception:
        reservation.rollback()
        raise
    else:
        reservation.commit()
```

A reservation is single-use. Calling `commit()` or `rollback()` after it has
already been finalized raises `RuntimeError`.

## Apply post-trade reports

```python
post_trade = engine.apply_execution_report(report=report)
if post_trade.kill_switch_triggered:
    print("halt new orders until the blocked state is cleared")
```

Reports are how stateful policies receive realized trading outcomes.

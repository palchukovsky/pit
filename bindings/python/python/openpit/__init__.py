"""Embeddable pre-trade risk SDK for trading systems.

``openpit`` evaluates orders through a deterministic two-stage pipeline
before they leave the application. The package provides:

- :class:`Engine` - pre-trade risk engine.
- :mod:`~openpit.param` - typed financial values (Price, Pnl, Quantity, etc.)
  with exact decimal arithmetic.
- :mod:`~openpit.pretrade` - pluggable policy interfaces, standard reject
  codes, deferred requests, and reservations.
- :mod:`~openpit.core` - order, execution-report, and account-adjustment group models.

Quickstart::

    import openpit

    engine = (
        openpit.Engine.builder()
        .no_sync()
        .builtin(openpit.pretrade.policies.build_order_validation())
        .build()
    )

    order = openpit.Order(
        operation=openpit.OrderOperation(
            instrument=openpit.Instrument("AAPL", "USD"),
            account_id=openpit.param.AccountId.from_u64(99224416),
            side=openpit.param.Side.BUY,
            trade_amount=openpit.param.TradeAmount.quantity(100.0),
            price=openpit.param.Price(185.0),
        ),
    )

    result = engine.start_pre_trade(order=order)

Threading:
The SDK never spawns OS threads: each public method runs on the OS thread that
invoked it. The engine handle's threading capability depends on the sync policy
selected at builder time:

- `full_sync()` - concurrent invocation on the same handle is safe;
  sequential cross-thread invocation is also safe.
- `no_sync()` - the handle stays on the OS thread that created the
  engine.
- `account_sync()` - concurrent invocation on the same handle is safe when
  the caller pins each account to a single chain (one queue or one worker at a
  time), so calls for the same account are never concurrent.

First stage of the engine builder. Select a synchronization policy via
`full_sync()`, `no_sync()`, or `account_sync()`.

Prefer `no_sync()` when you do not explicitly work with multiple threads
yourself: it has zero synchronization overhead and is the right default for
embeddings that drive the engine from a single thread (synchronous code or one
asyncio loop). Use `full_sync()` when sharing the engine across threads
concurrently. Use `account_sync()` for sharded sequential workloads where
each account is pinned to one processing chain. Storage owned by built-in or
custom policies is always account-keyed regardless of sync mode.

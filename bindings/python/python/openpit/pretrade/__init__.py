Context.__doc__ = """
Opaque context object passed to Python policy callbacks.

The object identifies the current engine evaluation context. Treat it as
read-only. Future releases may expose additional query methods on this object;
policies should not create instances directly.

``account_control`` is an :class:`AccountControl` when the engine exposes the
account-block facility for the evaluated account, otherwise ``None``. A policy
may capture it into a :class:`openpit.Mutation` rollback/commit closure to block
the account on a deferred failure. The handle is valid only within this
request's pre-trade processing (through its reservation's commit or rollback);
using it afterwards is unspecified.
"""

ExecuteResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``Request.execute`` or ``Engine.execute_pre_trade``.

Attributes:
    ok: ``True`` when all evaluated stages accepted the order.
    reservation: ``Reservation`` on success, otherwise ``None``.
    rejects: Ordered list of business rejects when ``ok`` is ``False``.

Successful results must be finalized by committing or rolling back the
reservation. Failed results never contain a reservation.
"""

PostTradeResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``openpit.Engine.apply_execution_report``.

Post-trade processing is not atomic: ``account_adjustments`` reflect storage
mutations that have already been applied, so callers must propagate them
downstream even when ``account_blocks`` is non-empty.

Attributes:
    account_blocks: List of account blocks reported by policies. Non-empty
        when at least one policy entered a blocked state after the report.
    account_adjustments: List of per-asset position outcomes reported by
        policies, in policy registration order.
"""

Reject.__doc__ = """
Business reject returned by start-stage or main-stage checks.

Rejects are normal policy outcomes, not exceptional failures.

Attributes:
    code: Stable machine-readable reject code.
    reason: Short human-readable reason.
    details: Diagnostic text intended for logs and operators.
    policy: Name of the policy that produced the reject.
    scope: ``RejectScope.ORDER`` or ``RejectScope.ACCOUNT``.
    user_data: Opaque caller-defined integer token copied from custom rejects.
"""

Request.__doc__ = """
Deferred main-stage request handle produced by ``Engine.start_pre_trade``.

The handle is single-use. Calling ``execute`` more than once raises
``RuntimeError``. Keep the handle only while the caller is ready to enter the
main stage; it represents a snapshot of the submitted order.
"""

Reservation.__doc__ = """
Single-use reservation handle returned by successful main-stage execution.

Call ``commit`` only after the order has been accepted by the downstream venue
or transport. Call ``rollback`` when submission fails or the caller decides not
to send the order. Calling either finalizer more than once raises
``RuntimeError``.
"""

StartResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``Engine.start_pre_trade``.

Attributes:
    ok: ``True`` when start-stage checks accepted the order.
    request: Deferred ``Request`` on success, otherwise ``None``.
    rejects: Merged start-stage reject list when ``ok`` is ``False``.
"""

AccountAdjustmentBatchResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``Engine.apply_account_adjustment``.

Attributes:
    ok: ``True`` when the whole adjustment batch passed.
    failed_index: Zero-based index of the first rejected adjustment, or
        ``None`` on success.
    rejects: Reject list returned for the failed adjustment.
"""

DryRunReport.__doc__ = """
Inert verdict of a non-mutating pre-trade dry-run.

Describes what ``Engine.execute_pre_trade`` or ``Engine.start_pre_trade``
would have produced for the same order and engine state, without moving any
engine state: no rate-limit budget is spent, no reservation or hold is
applied, and no account is blocked.

Attributes:
    is_pass: ``True`` when the order would have been admitted by all stages.
        Equivalent to ``bool(report)``.
    rejects: List of ``Reject`` objects when ``is_pass`` is ``False``,
        otherwise ``None``.
    account_block: ``AccountBlock`` that a real call would have recorded in
        the engine's blocked-accounts registry, or ``None`` when the order
        would have passed or produced a non-account reject.

Methods:
    lock(): ``Lock`` the main stage would have produced. Empty when the start
        stage would have rejected or no policy locks a price.
    account_adjustments(): List of ``AccountAdjustmentOutcome`` objects the
        main stage would have produced. Empty when the start stage would have
        rejected or no policy reports an adjustment.

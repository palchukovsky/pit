Context.__doc__ = """
Opaque context object passed to Python policy callbacks.

The object identifies the current engine evaluation context. Treat it as
read-only. Future releases may expose additional query methods on this object;
policies should not create instances directly.
"""

ExecuteResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``Request.execute`` or ``Engine.execute_pre_trade``.

Attributes:
    ok: ``True`` when all evaluated stages accepted the order.
    reservation: ``Reservation`` on success, otherwise ``None``.
    rejects: Ordered list of business rejects when ``ok`` is ``False``.

Successful results must be finalized by committing or rolling back the
reservation. Failed results never contain a reservation.
"""

PostTradeResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``openpit.Engine.apply_execution_report``.

Attributes:
    kill_switch_triggered: ``True`` when at least one policy reports that new
        requests for the account should be blocked after processing the report.
"""

Reject.__doc__ = """
Business reject returned by start-stage or main-stage checks.

Rejects are normal policy outcomes, not exceptional failures.

Attributes:
    code: Stable machine-readable reject code.
    reason: Short human-readable reason.
    details: Diagnostic text intended for logs and operators.
    policy: Name of the policy that produced the reject.
    scope: ``RejectScope.ORDER`` or ``RejectScope.ACCOUNT``.
    user_data: Opaque caller-defined integer token copied from custom rejects.
"""

Request.__doc__ = """
Deferred main-stage request handle produced by ``Engine.start_pre_trade``.

The handle is single-use. Calling ``execute`` more than once raises
``RuntimeError``. Keep the handle only while the caller is ready to enter the
main stage; it represents a snapshot of the submitted order.
"""

Reservation.__doc__ = """
Single-use reservation handle returned by successful main-stage execution.

Call ``commit`` only after the order has been accepted by the downstream venue
or transport. Call ``rollback`` when submission fails or the caller decides not
to send the order. Calling either finalizer more than once raises
``RuntimeError``.
"""

StartResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``Engine.start_pre_trade``.

Attributes:
    ok: ``True`` when start-stage checks accepted the order.
    request: Deferred ``Request`` on success, otherwise ``None``.
    rejects: Merged start-stage reject list when ``ok`` is ``False``.
"""

AccountAdjustmentBatchResult.__doc__ = """
Result of ``Engine.apply_account_adjustment``.

Attributes:
    ok: ``True`` when the whole adjustment batch passed.
    failed_index: Zero-based index of the first rejected adjustment, or
        ``None`` on success.
    rejects: Reject list returned for the failed adjustment.

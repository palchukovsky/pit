risk checks into trading systems.

## Versioning Policy (Pre‑1.0)

Until OpenPit reaches a stable `1.0` release, the project follows a relaxed
interpretation of Semantic Versioning.

During this phase:

- `PATCH` releases are used for bug fixes and small internal corrections.
- `MINOR` releases may introduce new features **and may also change the public
  interface**.

This means that breaking API changes can appear in minor releases before `1.0`.
Consumers of the library should take this into account when declaring
dependencies and consider using version constraints that tolerate API
evolution during the pre‑stable phase.

## Getting Started

Visit the [crate page on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/openpit) and the
[API documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/openpit/latest/openpit/).

## Install

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```bash
cargo add openpit
```

## Engine

### Overview

The engine evaluates an order through a deterministic pre-trade pipeline:

- `start_pre_trade(order)` runs lightweight start-stage policies
- `PreTradeRequest::execute()` runs main-stage policies
- `PreTradeReservation::commit()` applies reserved state
- dropping `PreTradeReservation` rolls state back automatically
- `apply_execution_report(report)` updates post-trade policy state

Start-stage policies aggregate rejects from all registered policies. Main-stage
policies aggregate rejects and roll back registered mutations in reverse order
when any reject is produced.

Built-in start-stage policies currently include:

- `OrderValidationPolicy`
- `PnlBoundsKillSwitchPolicy`
- `RateLimitPolicy`
- `OrderSizeLimitPolicy`

The primary integration model is to write project-specific policies against the
public Rust policy API described in the wiki: [Custom Rust policies](https://github.com/openpitkit/pit/wiki/Policies#rust-custom-policy-api).

There are two types of rejections: a full kill switch for the account and a
rejection of only the current request. This is useful in algorithmic trading
when automatic order submission must be halted until the situation is analyzed.

## Threading

Canonical contract: [Threading Contract](https://github.com/openpitkit/pit/wiki/Threading-Contract).

Custom policies that need internal state across calls use the built-in
[Storage](https://github.com/openpitkit/pit/wiki/Storage) abstraction.
The synchronization policy - no-sync, full-sync, or caller-sharded for
per-key parallelism - is selected once at engine construction and applied
transparently. The policy code never names a lock primitive; misuse is
prevented at compile time.

1. The SDK never spawns OS threads. Every public method runs on the OS thread
   that invoked that method.
2. Concurrent invocation of any public method on the same SDK handle is the
   caller's responsibility to prevent. Entering one handle concurrently from
   multiple threads is undefined behavior.
3. Sequential calls to public methods on the same handle from different OS
   threads are supported. Handles, contexts, and callbacks are not pinned to a
   specific thread.
4. `Reject.user_data` / `Order.user_data` / `ExecutionReport.user_data` /
   `AccountAdjustment.user_data` are opaque caller tokens. The SDK never
   inspects, dereferences, or frees them. Lifetime, thread-safety, and meaning
   are entirely caller-managed.

## Usage

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use openpit::{
    FinancialImpact, ExecutionReportOperation, OrderOperation,
    WithFinancialImpact, WithExecutionReportOperation,
};
use openpit::param::{
    AccountId, Asset, Fee, Pnl, Price, Quantity, Side, TradeAmount, Volume,
};
use openpit::pretrade::policies::{
    OrderSizeAssetBarrier, OrderSizeLimit, OrderSizeLimitPolicy,
    OrderValidationPolicy,
    PnlBoundsBrokerBarrier, PnlBoundsKillSwitchPolicy,
    RateLimit, RateLimitBrokerBarrier, RateLimitPolicy,
};
use openpit::{Engine, Instrument};

# fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let usd = Asset::new("USD")?;

// 1. Configure policies.
let builder = Engine::builder().no_sync();

let pnl_policy = PnlBoundsKillSwitchPolicy::new(
    [PnlBoundsBrokerBarrier {
        settlement_asset: usd.clone(),
        lower_bound: Some(Pnl::from_str("-1000")?),
        upper_bound: None,
    }],
    [],
    builder.storage_builder(),
)?;

let rate_limit_policy = RateLimitPolicy::new(
    Some(RateLimitBrokerBarrier {
        limit: RateLimit {
            max_orders: 100,
            window: Duration::from_secs(1),
        },
    }),
    [],
    [],
    [],
    builder.storage_builder(),
)?;

let size_policy = OrderSizeLimitPolicy::new(
    None,
    [OrderSizeAssetBarrier {
        limit: OrderSizeLimit {
            max_quantity: Quantity::from_str("500")?,
            max_notional: Volume::from_str("100000")?,
        },
        settlement_asset: usd.clone(),
    }],
    [],
)?;

// 2. Build the engine (one time at the platform initialization).
let engine = builder
    .pre_trade(OrderValidationPolicy::new())
    .pre_trade(pnl_policy)
    .pre_trade(rate_limit_policy)
    .pre_trade(size_policy)
    .build()?;

// 3. Check an order.
let order = OrderOperation {
    instrument: Instrument::new(
        Asset::new("AAPL")?,
        usd.clone(),
    ),
    account_id: AccountId::from_u64(99224416),
    side: Side::Buy,
    trade_amount: TradeAmount::Quantity(
        Quantity::from_f64(100.0)?,
    ),
    price: Some(Price::from_str("185")?),
};

let request = engine.start_pre_trade(order)?;

// 4. Quick, lightweight checks, such as fat-finger scope or enabled killswitch,
// were performed during pre-trade request creation. The system state has not
// yet changed, except in cases where each request, even rejected ones, must be
// considered (for example, to prevent frequent transfers). Before the
// heavy-duty checks, other work on the request can be performed simply by
// holding the request object.

// 5. Real pre-trade and risk control.
let mut reservation = request.execute()?;

// Optional shortcut for the same two-stage flow:
// let reservation = engine.execute_pre_trade(order)?;

// 6. If the request is successfully sent to the venue, it must be committed.
// The rollback must be called otherwise to revert all performed reservations.
reservation.commit();

// 5. The order goes to the venue and returns with an execution report.
let report = WithExecutionReportOperation {
    inner: WithFinancialImpact {
        inner: (),
        financial_impact: FinancialImpact {
            pnl: Pnl::from_str("-50")?,
            fee: Fee::from_str("3.4")?,
        },
    },
    operation: ExecutionReportOperation {
        instrument: Instrument::new(
            Asset::new("AAPL")?,
            usd,
        ),
        account_id: AccountId::from_u64(99224416),
        side: Side::Buy,
    },
};

let result = engine.apply_execution_report(&report);

// 6. After each execution report is applied, the system may report that it has
// been determined in advance that all subsequent requests will be rejected if
// the account status does not change.
assert!(!result.kill_switch_triggered);
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Errors

Rejects from `start_pre_trade(order)` and `PreTradeRequest::execute()` are
returned as
`Err(Reject)` and `Result<PreTradeReservation, Vec<Reject>>`.

Each `Reject` contains:

- `policy`: policy name
- `code`: stable machine-readable code (for example `RejectCode::OrderQtyExceedsLimit`)
- `reason`: short human-readable reject type (for example `"order quantity exceeded"`)
- `details`: concrete case details (for example `"requested 11, max allowed: 10"`)
- `scope`: `RejectScope::Order` or `RejectScope::Account`
- `user_data`: opaque caller-defined pointer payload (`null` by default)

`RejectCode` values are standardized and stable across Rust, Python, and C FFI.

//! Compile-time bound that ties account-sharded storages to keys identifying
//! an account.
//!
//! [`AccountKey`] is the engine-level marker that says "this storage key
//! identifies an account, and so the storage may be sharded by account".
//! [`AccountKeyConstraint`] adapts that marker to the storage layer's
//! [`IndexKeyBound`](crate::storage::IndexKeyBound) interface so that the
//! engine builder's
//! [`account_sync`](crate::EngineBuilder::account_sync) entry
//! point can pin its storages to keys that satisfy [`AccountKey`] at
//! compile time.

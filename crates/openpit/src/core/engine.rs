/// Generic parameters:
/// - `Trait`: aggregate of order, execution-report, account-adjustment, and
///   synchronization-mode choices.
///
/// # Threading
///
/// The engine handle's thread-safety is determined by `Trait::Sync`:
///
/// - [`LocalSync`] (default, produced by `no_sync`): the handle
///   is `!Send + !Sync`. Keep it on the OS thread that created it. Concurrent
///   invocation is not supported.
/// - [`FullSync`] (produced by `full_sync`): the handle is
///   `Send + Sync` when all registered policies are `Send + Sync`. It can be
///   wrapped in `Arc<FullSyncEngine<...>>` and shared across threads. With
///   `FullLocking` storage, concurrent invocation from multiple threads is
///   safe.
/// - [`AccountSync`] (produced by `account_sync`): the handle
///   is `Send + !Sync`. Ownership may move between OS threads sequentially, but
///   concurrent invocation on the same handle is not supported.

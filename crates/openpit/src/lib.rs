//! Embeddable pre-trade risk engine for trading systems.
//!
//! `openpit` focuses on the moment before an order leaves the application.
//! The crate provides:
//!
//! - [`Engine`] to coordinate pre-trade checks and post-trade feedback;
//! - [`param`] for typed financial values such as [`param::Price`] and
//!   [`param::Pnl`];
//! - [`core`] for foundational trading entities such as [`Order`] and
//!   [`Instrument`];
//! - [`pretrade`] for policy traits, rejects, deferred requests, and
//!   reservations.
//!
//! The pipeline is intentionally explicit:
//!
//! 1. [`Engine::start_pre_trade`] runs start-stage policies and returns a
//!    [`pretrade::Request`].
//! 2. [`pretrade::Request::execute`] runs main-stage policies and returns a
//!    [`pretrade::Reservation`].
//! 3. [`pretrade::Reservation::commit`] or
//!    [`pretrade::Reservation::rollback`] finalizes reserved state.
//! 4. [`Engine::apply_execution_report`] feeds realized outcomes back into
//!    policies.
//!
//! The current crate scope is deliberately narrow: in-memory admission control,
//! exact decimal value types, and a small set of built-in start-stage
//! policies. Persistence, market connectivity, and thread synchronization stay
//! with the caller.

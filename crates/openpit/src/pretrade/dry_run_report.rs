/// Inert verdict of a pre-trade dry-run.
///
/// A dry-run runs every pre-trade policy against the current engine state and
/// reports what *would* happen, with zero effect on that state: no rate-limit
/// budget is spent, no reservation or hold is applied, and no account is
/// blocked. Repeating a dry-run never moves engine state.
///
/// Unlike [`PreTradeReservation`](crate::pretrade::PreTradeReservation), this
/// report carries no commit/rollback capability. It is inert by construction -
/// there is nothing to finalize - so it exposes no `commit`/`rollback` methods.
/// The fields describe the outcome the equivalent real call would have produced:
///
/// - [`is_pass`](Self::is_pass) / [`rejects`](Self::rejects): whether the order
///   would have been admitted, and the rejects it would have collected
///   otherwise.
/// - [`lock`](Self::lock): the [`PreTradeLock`] the main stage would have
///   produced (empty when the start stage would have rejected, or when no
///   policy locks anything).
/// - [`account_adjustments`](Self::account_adjustments): the per-asset
///   `held`/`available` outcomes the main stage would have produced, with the
///   same numbers a real reservation would report for the same order and state.
/// - [`account_block`](Self::account_block): the [`AccountBlock`] an
///   account-scope reject would have latched - reported here, but *not* recorded
///   in the engine's blocked-accounts registry.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// use openpit::param::{Asset, Price, Quantity, Side, TradeAmount};
/// use openpit::{Engine, Instrument, OrderOperation};
/// use openpit::pretrade::policies::OrderValidationPolicy;
///
/// let engine = Engine::builder::<OrderOperation, (), ()>()
///     .no_sync()
///     .pre_trade(OrderValidationPolicy::new())
///     .build()?;
/// let order = OrderOperation {
///     instrument: Instrument::new(Asset::new("AAPL")?, Asset::new("USD")?),
///     account_id: openpit::param::AccountId::from_u64(99224416),
///     side: Side::Buy,
///     trade_amount: TradeAmount::Quantity(Quantity::from_str("10")?),
///     price: Some(Price::from_str("185")?),
/// };
///
/// // A dry-run leaves the engine untouched: a later real call behaves as if
/// // the dry-run never happened.
/// let report = engine.execute_pre_trade_dry_run(order.clone());
/// if report.is_pass() {
///     let mut reservation = engine.start_pre_trade(order)?.execute()?;
///     reservation.commit();
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }

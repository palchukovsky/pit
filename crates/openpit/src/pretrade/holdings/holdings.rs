/// not yet settled: a pre-trade reservation projects the acquiring leg's

/// account adjustments may force it directly. `incoming` is purely
/// informational: it is never part of spendable capacity and never gates a
/// reservation (see [`Holdings::try_hold`]).
///
/// `avg_entry_price` is the average entry price of the current net owned
/// position (`available + held`), denominated in the account currency; it is
/// `None` when that net is flat or average tracking is unavailable.
/// `realized_pnl` is the cumulative realized profit and loss for this slot,
/// also denominated in the account currency. `None` means realized PnL is not
/// tracked. Missing account currency or missing FX clears both fields and does
/// not reject or block the fill. Both fields evolve online via
/// [`Holdings::realize_position_fill`] on the underlying leg of a fill and can
/// be force-set through account-adjustment balance operations; reservation and
/// cancel move funds between `available` and `held` without touching either
/// field.
///
/// `try_hold` is the only operation that enforces a financial invariant:
/// the reservation requires `amount <= available + min(held, 0)`. A
/// negative `held` (manager-initiated adjustment) reduces the spendable
/// capacity below `available`. All other mutating operations apply
/// arithmetic directly without non-negative guards — negative `amount`
/// inverts the direction — and only fail on decimal-range overflow.
///
/// Operations return a new `Holdings` (immutable update). This makes
/// rollback straightforward for the caller: capture the old value, write
/// the new value synchronously, and push a rollback `Mutation` that

use super::PreTradeLock;

/// Opaque capability object representing reserved state.
///
/// `PreTradeReservation` is the result of successful pre-trade execution. It owns the
/// commit/rollback capability for the mutations prepared by policies, and it
/// also carries the [`PreTradeLock`] produced while those mutations were built.
///
/// The lock is part of the reservation contract. It is the policy context that
/// describes what was actually locked and which values must survive beyond the
/// synchronous pre-trade phase. This matters when later reconciliation depends
/// on execution-report details, especially partial fills and final reports.
///
/// If a policy needs trade execution report fill details to finalize reserved
/// state, the caller must persist [`PreTradeReservation::lock`] together with the order
/// and keep it until the last execution report for that order has been
/// processed. A final order state alone is not sufficient if the policy also
/// needs fill-by-fill data to determine how much of the reservation was truly
/// consumed and how much must be released.
///
/// Example: a policy may reserve quote notional using a pre-trade worst price.
/// When fills arrive, the engine may need that stored reservation context to
/// compute the unused remainder and unlock it correctly. If the lock is lost,
/// post-trade code no longer has the authoritative context produced by
/// pre-trade validation.
///
/// If dropped without explicit finalization, rollback is executed automatically.
///
/// # Lifecycle guidance
///
/// - Keep the `PreTradeReservation` alive until the order is actually sent.
/// - Call [`PreTradeReservation::commit`] only after the venue accepted the order and
///   the reservation must become durable engine state.
/// - Call [`PreTradeReservation::rollback`] if submission fails and reserved state must
///   be reverted immediately.
/// - After commit, persist [`PreTradeReservation::lock`] if later execution-report
///   processing depends on reservation-time policy context.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
/// use openpit::param::{Asset, Price, Quantity, Side};
/// use openpit::{Engine, Instrument, OrderOperation};
/// use openpit::param::TradeAmount;

///         Asset::new("USD")?,

///         Quantity::from_str("10")?
///     ),
///     price: Some(Price::from_str("185")?),
/// };
/// let mut reservation = engine.start_pre_trade(order)?.execute()?;
/// let lock = *reservation.lock();
///
/// // Send order to venue. On success commit, on failure rollback.
/// reservation.commit(); // or reservation.rollback()

//! Storage builder.

use super::key_bound::CreateStorageFor;
use super::storage::Storage;

/// Builder for [`Storage`] instances configured with a specific
/// [`LockingPolicyFactory`](super::LockingPolicyFactory).
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// Trading policies built on `openpit` typically maintain in-memory state
/// (reserved margin, position tracking, rate-limit counters, …) that must
/// be thread-safe in multi-threaded embeddings yet have zero overhead in
/// single-threaded ones. Rather than implementing ad hoc synchronization
/// in every policy, the recommended pattern is:
///
/// 1. Accept a `&StorageBuilder<Factory>` obtained from an engine builder
///    at policy construction time.
/// 2. Call [`create`](Self::create) for each internal data table.
/// 3. Operate on the resulting [`Storage`] instances exclusively through
///    [`Storage::with`](super::Storage::with) and
///    [`Storage::with_mut`](super::Storage::with_mut).
///
/// The synchronization mode is then entirely determined by the engine's
/// synchronization policy, not by the policy. Switching from no-sync to
/// fully-synchronized execution only requires changing the engine builder's
/// sync policy - the policy logic is untouched.
///
/// # Lifetime discipline
///
/// `StorageBuilder` is intentionally **not [`Clone`]**. The intended usage
/// is for the engine builder to own it during the application's
/// initialization phase. Application code passes
/// [`SyncedEngineBuilder::storage_builder`](crate::SyncedEngineBuilder::storage_builder)
/// by shared reference to every policy that needs to create storages.
///
/// Storing a `StorageBuilder` inside a policy — even by value through
/// unsafe code — is a misuse: the builder is only meaningful during
/// initialization, after which the storages it produced are already live
/// and the builder itself carries no additional information.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use openpit::Engine;
///
/// let engine_builder = Engine::<(), ()>::builder().full_sync();
/// let users = engine_builder.storage_builder().create::<u64, String>();
/// let orders = engine_builder.storage_builder().create::<u64, Vec<u8>>();
/// // `users` and `orders` are unrelated storages; locking one does
/// // not affect the other.
/// users.with_mut(1, || "alice".to_string(), |_, _| {});
/// orders.with_mut(42, Vec::new, |_, _| {});
/// ```

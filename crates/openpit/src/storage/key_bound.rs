//! Key-bound markers and creation permissions for [`Storage`](super::Storage).
//!
//! The storage layer is intentionally domain-neutral: it knows nothing about
//! `AccountId` or any other application concept. To let layers above attach
//! compile-time bounds on the storage key without leaking domain types into
//! `storage`, two opaque markers are exposed here:
//!
//! * [`IndexKeyBound`] is the contract a key must satisfy under a given
//!   [`IndexLocking`](super::IndexLocking) parameterisation. Concrete bounds
//!   are introduced by users of the storage (for example, the engine layer
//!   adds `AccountKeyConstraint` for account-sharded storages).
//! * [`AnyKey`] is the default bound: every key satisfies it.
//! * [`CreateStorageFor`] is a permission marker on
//!   [`LockingPolicyFactory`](super::LockingPolicyFactory) that controls
//!   which key types a factory can produce storages for through
//!   [`StorageBuilder::create`](super::StorageBuilder::create).

/// implementations and imposes no bound of its own. Layers above (engine,
/// custom embeddings) define concrete markers and decide which keys those
/// markers admit. See `AccountKeyConstraint` in the engine layer for the
/// canonical example.
///
/// The `'static` super-bound mirrors the lifetime requirements of the
/// keys actually stored in the [`Storage`](super::Storage) and lets the

/// Locking policy factory that synchronizes the **index** but leaves

///
/// A [`Storage`](crate::storage::Storage) configured with `IndexLocking`
/// allows concurrent inserts, removals, and lookups of keys (the index
/// is protected by a reader-writer lock), but reads and writes of the
/// values themselves are not synchronized. The caller must ensure
/// values are either thread-safe internally or accessed under their own
/// external discipline (for example, only one thread mutates values).
///
/// # Aliasing safety
///
/// The closure-based access methods on
/// [`Storage`](crate::storage::Storage) confine references to the call
/// that produced them. Read-from-read re-entry is allowed because it
/// creates only shared references. Any re-entry path involving a write
/// hold would alias `&mut Value` while another values borrow is still
/// live; it is detected by `Storage` in debug builds and panics with a
/// clear message. Release builds skip the check.
///
/// # Compile-time key bound
///
/// The `KeyBound` type parameter selects which keys this factory will
/// produce storages for. The default,
/// [`AnyKey`](crate::storage::AnyKey), accepts any
/// [`Hash`](std::hash::Hash) + [`Eq`] key. Embeddings can substitute a
/// stricter marker that implements
/// [`IndexKeyBound`](crate::storage::IndexKeyBound) for only a subset
/// of keys; attempting to construct a storage with a key the marker
/// does not admit then becomes a compile-time error.
///
/// `KeyBound` carries no runtime data (it lives behind a
/// `PhantomData<fn() -> KeyBound>` so it does not affect [`Send`] /
/// [`Sync`] inheritance) and exists purely to gate
/// [`StorageBuilder::create_for_bound_key`](crate::storage::StorageBuilder::create_for_bound_key).
///
/// # Thread safety
///
/// Storages built with `IndexLocking` are [`Send`] (provided
/// `Key: Send` and `Value: Send`) but **not** [`Sync`]. The values
/// domain is left unsynchronized, so sharing `&Storage` across threads
/// would race on values; the type system rejects that at compile time.
/// To use the storage from multiple threads, transfer ownership (move
/// it across a channel, wrap in a `Mutex<Storage<..>>`, etc.) or
/// switch to [`FullLocking`](crate::storage::FullLocking), which
/// implements
/// [`FullySynchronized`](crate::storage::FullySynchronized).
///
/// The following must therefore fail to compile:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use std::thread;
/// use openpit::Engine;
///
/// let builder = Engine::builder::<(), ()>().account_sync();
/// let storage = Arc::new(builder.storage_builder().create_for_bound_key::<u64, u64>());
/// let s2 = Arc::clone(&storage);
/// thread::spawn(move || {
///     let _ = s2.with(&1, |v| *v);
/// });

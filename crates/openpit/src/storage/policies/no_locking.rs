/// Locking policy factory that performs **no synchronization** at all.
///
/// A [`Storage`](crate::storage::Storage) configured with `NoLocking`
/// has zero runtime synchronization overhead but is not thread-safe: it
/// is `!Send` and `!Sync`. The Rust type system enforces single-threaded
/// use.
///
/// # Aliasing safety
///
/// The closure-based access methods on
/// [`Storage`](crate::storage::Storage) ensure that references handed to
/// the caller never escape the call that produced them. Read-from-read
/// re-entry is allowed because it creates only shared references. Any
/// re-entry path involving a write hold is detected by `Storage` in
/// debug builds and panics with a clear message; release builds skip the
/// check and pay nothing extra.
///
/// Use this when the storage lives entirely on the stack of one thread
/// or behind an external synchronization primitive of the caller's
/// choosing.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use openpit::Engine;
///
/// let builder = Engine::builder::<(), (), ()>().no_sync();
/// let storage = builder.storage_builder().create_for_bound_key::<u32, String>();
/// storage.with_mut(1, || "hello".to_string(), |entry, is_new| {
///     assert!(is_new);
///     entry.push_str(", world");
/// });
/// assert_eq!(
///     storage.with(&1, |v| v.clone()),
///     Some("hello, world".to_string()),
/// );

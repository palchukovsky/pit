//! Locking policy traits.
//!
//! [`LockingPolicy`] abstracts over the synchronization scheme used by a
//! [`Storage`](super::Storage) instance. A storage owns one policy instance,
//! created by a [`LockingPolicyFactory`]. The factory is the type-level
//! configuration on a [`StorageBuilder`](super::StorageBuilder); each call to
//! [`StorageBuilder::create_for_bound_key`](super::StorageBuilder::create_for_bound_key) produces a fresh
//! policy via [`LockingPolicyFactory::create_policy`], so every storage has
//! its own private locks.
//!
//! # Lock domains
//!
//! A policy controls two independent lock domains:
//!
//! * **Index** — the set of keys present in the storage. Acquired
//!   exclusively when keys are added or removed; acquired shared when an
//!   existing key is looked up.
//! * **Values** — the bag of all values stored under those keys. Acquired
//!   exclusively when any value is mutated; acquired shared when any value
//!   is read. The key of the entry being accessed is passed as an argument
//!   so that future implementations can apply per-key granularity; the
//!   built-in policies ignore it.
//!
//! # Acquisition order
//!
//! Storage operations always acquire **index before values**. Implementations
//! must not introduce any other ordering, otherwise deadlocks are possible.

use std::marker::PhantomData;

/// Synchronization strategy used by a [`Storage`](super::Storage).
///
/// A policy provides four lock acquisitions, one per `(domain, mode)` pair
/// where the domain is index or values and the mode is shared (multiple
/// concurrent holders, no mutators) or exclusive (single holder, no other
/// readers or writers).
///
/// The `read_values` and `write_values` methods receive the key of the
/// entry being accessed. The built-in implementations ignore this argument;
/// it is reserved for custom implementations that want to apply per-key
/// granularity. The argument is generic so that no `Key` type-parameter
/// propagates into the trait itself, keeping the trait object-capable in
/// principle and straightforward to implement for all key types at once.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `Storage` relies on the policy to uphold the following invariants:
///
/// * While any [`Self::IndexSharedGuard`] is alive, no thread modifies the
///   set of keys present in the owning storage.
/// * While any [`Self::IndexExclusiveGuard`] is alive, no other thread holds
///   any index guard for the same storage.
/// * While any [`Self::ValuesSharedGuard`] is alive, no thread mutates any
///   value in the owning storage.
/// * While any [`Self::ValuesExclusiveGuard`] is alive, no other thread
///   holds any values guard for the same storage.
///
/// The built-in implementations supplied with this crate
/// ([`NoLocking`](super::NoLocking), [`IndexLocking`](super::IndexLocking)
/// and [`FullLocking`](super::FullLocking)) honour these invariants. Custom
/// implementations are responsible for their own correctness; getting the
/// invariants wrong leads to undefined behaviour.
///
/// `NoLocking` honours the invariants vacuously by making the storage
/// `!Sync`: the Rust type system guarantees that no two threads can ever
/// observe the storage at the same time. The caller is then responsible
/// for not creating overlapping mutable borrows within that single thread,
/// the same contract as for direct use of [`std::cell::UnsafeCell`].

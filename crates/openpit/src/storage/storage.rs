/// Generic key-value storage whose synchronization is configured at the
/// type level by `LockingPolicy: LockingPolicy`.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// Trading policies built on top of `openpit` often maintain internal
/// state — for example, reserved margin, open positions, and rate-limit
/// counters — that must be thread-safe when shared across engine threads.
/// Without a common abstraction each policy would have to implement its
/// own synchronization discipline: choose the right lock primitive,
/// acquire locks in a consistent order, ensure that the acquisition order
/// is respected across refactors, and handle the no-sync case for
/// single-threaded embeddings without conditional compilation.
///
/// `Storage` solves that problem once. A policy chooses a
/// [`LockingPolicyFactory`](super::LockingPolicyFactory) at construction
/// time and receives a ready-made `Storage` via
/// [`StorageBuilder::create`](super::StorageBuilder::create). From that
/// point on the policy reads and mutates its state through the scoped
/// [`Storage::with`] and [`Storage::with_mut`] methods, without ever
/// touching a lock primitive directly. If the embedding switches from
/// single-threaded to multi-threaded execution, only the factory type
/// changes; the policy logic is untouched.
///
/// # API surface
///
/// All accessors are scoped: the caller passes a closure that receives a
/// reference to the value, and the closure runs while the storage holds
/// the appropriate locks. Once the closure returns, the locks are
/// released. The reference never escapes the closure, which makes it
/// impossible for safe code to keep conflicting references to the same
/// value alive at the same time.
///
/// * [`Storage::with`] — invokes the closure with `&Value` if the key
///   exists; returns the closure's result wrapped in `Some`, or `None`
///   if the key is absent.
/// * [`Storage::with_mut`] — invokes the closure with `&mut Value`,
///   creating the entry on demand. The closure is also told whether the
///   entry was just inserted.
/// * [`Storage::remove`] — drops an entry; returns `true` if the key was
///   present.
/// * [`Storage::len`], [`Storage::is_empty`] — observers of the index.
///
/// All accessors take `&self` and acquire the locks defined by
/// `LockingPolicy`. Acquisition order is **always index before values**,
/// eliminating one common source of deadlocks.
///
/// # Closure re-entry
///
/// Calls into the same `Storage` from inside a closure passed to
/// [`Storage::with`] or [`Storage::with_mut`] follow these rules:
///
/// - A nested call to [`Storage::with`] from inside another
///   [`Storage::with`] closure on the same storage is allowed.
///   Multiple read holds on the values domain are sound: each yields
///   a shared `&Value` reference, and shared references do not alias
///   as `&mut` in safe code.
/// - A nested call to [`Storage::with_mut`] from inside any closure
///   on the same storage is forbidden. A write hold would produce
///   `&mut Value`, which conflicts with any other reference live on
///   the same value.
/// - A nested call to [`Storage::with`] from inside a
///   [`Storage::with_mut`] closure on the same storage is forbidden,
///   for the same aliasing reason.
///
/// Violations of the second and third rules are detected at runtime
/// in debug builds and panic with a clear message; release builds
/// skip the check for zero overhead and trust the contract.
///
/// For [`FullLocking`](super::FullLocking), nested read access uses
/// recursive read locks. Forbidden write re-entry may still deadlock
/// instead of panicking on release builds; the debug-only check upgrades
/// this to a clear panic during development.
///
/// # Cloning
///
/// [`Storage`] is intentionally not [`Clone`]. The synchronization
/// primitives owned by the policy are tied to one storage instance; any
/// notion of "the same storage" must be expressed by sharing through
/// `Arc<Storage<...>>`, never by copying.
///
/// # Thread safety
///
/// The thread-safety properties of [`Storage`] are inherited from the
/// policy:
///
/// * With [`NoLocking`](super::NoLocking) the storage is `!Send` and
///   `!Sync`; the Rust type system enforces single-threaded use.
/// * With [`IndexLocking`](super::IndexLocking) the storage is `Send`
///   (provided `Key` and `Value` are `Send`) but `!Sync`: the policy
///   synchronizes only the index domain. Ownership may be moved between
///   threads, but `&Storage` must not be shared simultaneously across
///   threads.
/// * With [`FullLocking`](super::FullLocking) the storage is
///   `Send + Sync` provided `Key` and `Value` themselves are
///   `Send + Sync`. `Sync` is gated on the policy implementing
///   [`FullySynchronized`](super::FullySynchronized).

[Back to index](index.md)

## `OpenPitSyncPolicy`

Runtime selector for the engine's storage synchronization policy.

```c
typedef uint8_t OpenPitSyncPolicy;
/**
 * Concurrent invocation of public methods on the same handle is safe.
 * Sequential cross-thread access is also safe. Use this when the engine is
 * shared across threads.
 */
#define OpenPitSyncPolicy_Full ((OpenPitSyncPolicy) 0)
/**
 * The handle stays on the OS thread that created it. Use this for
 * single-threaded embeddings where synchronization overhead must be zero.
 */
#define OpenPitSyncPolicy_Local ((OpenPitSyncPolicy) 1)
/**
 * Sequential cross-thread access on the same handle is safe; the caller pins
 * each account to a single processing chain (one queue or one worker at a
 * time). Concurrent invocation on the same handle is not supported in this
 * mode.
 */
#define OpenPitSyncPolicy_Account ((OpenPitSyncPolicy) 2)
```

## `OpenPitEngineBuilder`

Opaque builder pointer used to assemble an engine instance.

Ownership:

- returned by `openpit_create_engine_builder`;
- owned by the caller until passed to `openpit_destroy_engine_builder`;
- consumed by `openpit_engine_builder_build`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitEngineBuilder OpenPitEngineBuilder;
```

## `OpenPitEngine`

Opaque engine pointer.

The engine stores policies and mutable risk state. The caller owns the pointer
until `openpit_destroy_engine`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitEngine OpenPitEngine;
```

## `OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest`

Opaque pointer for a deferred pre-trade request.

This is returned by `openpit_engine_start_pre_trade`. It can be executed once
with `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute` or discarded with
`openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest;
```

## `OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation`

Opaque reservation pointer returned by a successful pre-trade check.

A reservation represents resources that have been tentatively locked. The caller
must resolve it exactly once by calling
`openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit`,
`openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_rollback`, or
`openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation;
```

## `OpenPitPretradePreTradeLock`

Price-lock snapshot returned from a reservation.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitPretradePreTradeLock {
    OpenPitParamPriceOptional price;
} OpenPitPretradePreTradeLock;
```

## `OpenPitPretradeStatus`

Result status for pre-trade operations.

```c
typedef uint8_t OpenPitPretradeStatus;
/**
 * Order/request passed this stage; read the success out-pointer.
 */
#define OpenPitPretradeStatus_Passed ((OpenPitPretradeStatus) 0)
/**
 * Order/request was rejected; read the reject out-pointer.
 */
#define OpenPitPretradeStatus_Rejected ((OpenPitPretradeStatus) 1)
/**
 * Call failed due to invalid input; read the error out-pointer.
 */
#define OpenPitPretradeStatus_Error ((OpenPitPretradeStatus) 2)
```

## `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError`

Batch rejection details returned by account-adjustment apply API.

Ownership:

- created by `openpit_engine_apply_account_adjustment` on `Rejected`;
- owned by the caller;
- released with `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError
    OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError;
```

## `openpit_create_engine_builder`

Creates a new engine builder with the chosen synchronization policy.

Success:

- returns a non-null caller-owned builder object.

Error:

- returns null when `sync_policy` is not one of `OpenPitSyncPolicy_Full` (0),
  `OpenPitSyncPolicy_Local` (1), or `OpenPitSyncPolicy_Account` (2);
- if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString`
  error handle that MUST be released with `openpit_destroy_shared_string`.

Cleanup:

- release the pointer with `openpit_destroy_engine_builder` if you stop before
  building;
- after a successful build the builder is consumed and must still be released
  with `openpit_destroy_engine_builder`.

```c
OpenPitEngineBuilder * openpit_create_engine_builder(
    uint8_t sync_policy,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_engine_builder`

Releases a builder pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- after this call the pointer is invalid;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_engine_builder(
    OpenPitEngineBuilder * builder
);
```

## `openpit_engine_builder_build`

Finalizes a builder and creates an engine.

Success:

- returns a non-null engine pointer.

Error:

- returns null when `builder` is null, the builder was already consumed, or
  configuration is invalid;
- if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString`
  error handle that MUST be released with `openpit_destroy_shared_string`.

Ownership:

- on success the returned engine pointer is owned by the caller and must be
  released with `openpit_destroy_engine`;
- the builder becomes consumed regardless of success and must not be reused.

```c
OpenPitEngine * openpit_engine_builder_build(
    OpenPitEngineBuilder * builder,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_engine`

Releases an engine pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- destroying the engine also releases any state and policies retained by that
  engine instance;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_engine(
    OpenPitEngine * engine
);
```

## `openpit_engine_start_pre_trade`

Starts pre-trade processing and returns a deferred request pointer.

This stage validates whether the order can enter the full pre-trade flow.

Success:

- returns `Passed` when the order passed this stage; read `out_request`;
- returns `Rejected` when the order was rejected; read `out_rejects` if not
  null.

Error:

- returns `Error` when input pointers are invalid or the order payload cannot
  be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Cleanup:

- release a successful request with
  `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute` or
  `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`.

Reject ownership contract:

- on `Rejected`, a non-null `OpenPitRejectList` pointer is written to
  `out_rejects` if it is not null;
- the caller takes ownership and MUST release it with
  `openpit_destroy_reject_list`; failing to do so leaks the heap allocation
  made inside this call;
- no thread-local state is involved, and the returned pointer is safe to read
  on any thread;
- on `Passed` and `Error`, null is written to `out_rejects`, and the caller
  must not call destroy in those cases.

Order lifetime contract:

- `order` is read as a borrowed view during this call;
- the operation snapshots that payload before returning, because the deferred
  request may outlive the source buffers.

```c
OpenPitPretradeStatus openpit_engine_start_pre_trade(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitOrder * order,
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest ** out_request,
    OpenPitRejectList ** out_rejects,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_execute_pre_trade`

Runs the complete pre-trade check in one call.

Success:

- returns `Passed` when the order passed this stage; read `out_reservation`;
- returns `Rejected` when the order was rejected is not null; read
  `out_rejects`.

Error:

- returns `Error` when input pointers are invalid or the order payload cannot
  be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Cleanup:

- release a successful reservation with
  `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit`,
  `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_rollback`, or
  `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation`.

Reject ownership contract:

- on `Rejected`, a non-null `OpenPitRejectList` pointer is written to
  `out_rejects` if it is not null;
- the caller takes ownership and MUST release it with
  `openpit_destroy_reject_list`; failing to do so leaks the heap allocation
  made inside this call;
- no thread-local state is involved, and the returned pointer is safe to read
  on any thread;
- on `Passed` and `Error`, null is written to `out_rejects`, and the caller
  must not call destroy in those cases.

Order lifetime contract:

- `order` is read as a borrowed view during this call only;
- the operation does not retain any pointer into source memory after this
  function returns.

```c
OpenPitPretradeStatus openpit_engine_execute_pre_trade(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitOrder * order,
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation ** out_reservation,
    OpenPitRejectList ** out_rejects,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute`

Executes a deferred request returned by `openpit_engine_start_pre_trade`.

Success:

- returns `Passed` when the order passed this stage; read `out_reservation`;
- returns `Rejected` when the order was rejected and `out_rejects` is not
  null; read `out_rejects`.

Error:

- returns `Error` when input pointers are invalid or the order payload cannot
  be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Ownership:

- this call consumes the request object's content exactly once;
- after a successful or failed execute, the object itself may still be
  released with `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`, but it cannot be
  executed again.

Reject ownership contract:

- on `Rejected`, a non-null `OpenPitRejectList` pointer is written to
  `out_rejects` if it is not null;
- the caller takes ownership and MUST release it with
  `openpit_destroy_reject_list`; failing to do so leaks the heap allocation
  made inside this call;
- no thread-local state is involved, and the returned pointer is safe to read
  on any thread;
- on `Passed` and `Error`, null is written to `out_rejects`, and the caller
  must not call destroy in those cases.

```c
OpenPitPretradeStatus openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute(
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest * request,
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation ** out_reservation,
    OpenPitRejectList ** out_rejects,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`

Releases a deferred request pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- destroying an unexecuted request abandons it without creating a reservation;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request(
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest * request
);
```

## `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit`

Finalizes a reservation and applies the reserved state permanently.

This call is idempotent at the pointer level: if the reservation was already
consumed, nothing happens. Passing null is allowed.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit(
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation * reservation
);
```

## `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_rollback`

Cancels a reservation and releases the reserved state.

This call is idempotent at the pointer level: if the reservation was already
consumed, nothing happens. Passing null is allowed.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_rollback(
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation * reservation
);
```

## `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_get_lock`

Returns a snapshot of the lock attached to a reservation.

Contract:

- `reservation` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call;
- this function never fails.

Lifetime contract:

- the returned snapshot is detached from the reservation state.

```c
OpenPitPretradePreTradeLock openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_get_lock(
    const OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation * reservation
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation`

Releases a reservation pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- destroying an unresolved reservation triggers rollback of any pending
  mutations;
- callers that need explicit resolution should call commit or rollback first;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation(
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation * reservation
);
```

## `OpenPitEngineApplyExecutionReportResult`

Result of `openpit_engine_apply_execution_report`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitEngineApplyExecutionReportResult {
    OpenPitPretradePostTradeResult post_trade_result;
    bool is_error;
} OpenPitEngineApplyExecutionReportResult;
```

## `openpit_engine_apply_execution_report`

Applies an execution report to engine state.

Success:

- returns `OpenPitEngineApplyExecutionReportResult { is_error = false, ... }`.

Error:

- returns `OpenPitEngineApplyExecutionReportResult { is_error = true, post_trade_result = { kill_switch_triggered = false } }` when input pointers
  are invalid or the report payload cannot be decoded;
- if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString`
  error handle that MUST be released with `openpit_destroy_shared_string`;
- when `is_error` is `true`, do not trust any other fields beyond the fact
  that the call failed.

Lifetime contract:

- `report` is read as a borrowed view during this call only;
- the operation does not retain any pointer into source memory after this
  function returns.

```c
OpenPitEngineApplyExecutionReportResult openpit_engine_apply_execution_report(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitExecutionReport * report,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error`

Releases a batch-error object returned by account-adjustment apply.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error(
    OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError * batch_error
);
```

## `openpit_account_adjustment_batch_error_get_failed_adjustment_index`

Returns the failing adjustment index from a batch error.

Contract:

- `batch_error` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
size_t openpit_account_adjustment_batch_error_get_failed_adjustment_index(
    const OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError * batch_error
);
```

## `openpit_account_adjustment_batch_error_get_rejects`

Returns a non-owning reject-list view from a batch error.

Contract:

- `batch_error` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- the returned pointer is valid while `batch_error` is alive;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
const OpenPitRejectList * openpit_account_adjustment_batch_error_get_rejects(
    const OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError * batch_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_apply_account_adjustment`

Applies a batch of account adjustments to one account.

Success:

- returns `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus::Applied` when the batch was
  accepted and applied;
- returns `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus::Rejected` when the call itself
  completed normally but a policy rejected the batch; read `out_reject`.

Error:

- returns `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus::Error` when input pointers are
  invalid or some adjustment payload cannot be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Result handling:

- `Applied` means there is no reject object to clean up;
- `Rejected` stores batch error details in `out_reject`, the caller must
  release a returned object with
  `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error`;
- rejects returned by `openpit_account_adjustment_batch_error_get_rejects`
  contain string views borrowed from the batch error and must not be used
  after the batch error is destroyed;
- when `Error` is returned, do not use any pointer from a previous unrelated
  call as if it belonged to this failure.

Lifetime contract:

- every `adjustment` entry from the contiguous input array is read as a
  borrowed view during this call only;
- release a returned batch error with
  `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error`.

```c
OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus openpit_engine_apply_account_adjustment(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountId account_id,
    const OpenPitAccountAdjustment * adjustments,
    size_t adjustments_len,
    OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError ** out_reject,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

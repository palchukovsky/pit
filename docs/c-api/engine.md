# Engine

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD024 -->

[Back to index](index.md)

## `OpenPitSyncPolicy`

Runtime selector for the engine's storage synchronization policy.

```c
typedef uint8_t OpenPitSyncPolicy;
/**
 * The handle stays on the OS thread that created it. Use this for
 * single-threaded embeddings where synchronization overhead must be zero.
 */
#define OpenPitSyncPolicy_None ((OpenPitSyncPolicy) 0)
/**
 * Concurrent invocation of public methods on the same handle is safe.
 * Sequential cross-thread access is also safe. Use this when the engine is
 * shared across threads.
 */
#define OpenPitSyncPolicy_Full ((OpenPitSyncPolicy) 1)
/**
 * Sequential cross-thread access on the same handle is safe; the caller pins
 * each account to a single processing chain (one queue or one worker at a
 * time). Concurrent invocation on the same handle is not supported in this
 * mode.
 */
#define OpenPitSyncPolicy_Account ((OpenPitSyncPolicy) 2)
```

## `OpenPitEngineBuilder`

Opaque builder pointer used to assemble an engine instance.

Ownership:

- returned by `openpit_create_engine_builder`;
- owned by the caller until passed to `openpit_destroy_engine_builder`;
- consumed by `openpit_engine_builder_build`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitEngineBuilder OpenPitEngineBuilder;
```

## `OpenPitEngine`

Opaque engine pointer.

The engine stores policies and mutable risk state. The caller owns the pointer
until `openpit_destroy_engine`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitEngine OpenPitEngine;
```

## `OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest`

Opaque pointer for a deferred pre-trade request.

This is returned by `openpit_engine_start_pre_trade`. It can be executed once
with `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute` or discarded with
`openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest;
```

## `OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation`

Opaque reservation pointer returned by a successful pre-trade check.

A reservation represents resources that have been tentatively locked. The caller
must resolve it exactly once by calling
`openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit`,
`openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_rollback`, or
`openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation;
```

## `OpenPitPretradeStatus`

Result status for pre-trade operations.

```c
typedef uint8_t OpenPitPretradeStatus;
/**
 * Order/request passed this stage; read the success out-pointer.
 */
#define OpenPitPretradeStatus_Passed ((OpenPitPretradeStatus) 0)
/**
 * Order/request was rejected; read the reject out-pointer.
 */
#define OpenPitPretradeStatus_Rejected ((OpenPitPretradeStatus) 1)
/**
 * Call failed due to invalid input; read the error out-pointer.
 */
#define OpenPitPretradeStatus_Error ((OpenPitPretradeStatus) 2)
```

## `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError`

Batch rejection details returned by account-adjustment apply API.

Ownership:

- created by `openpit_engine_apply_account_adjustment` on `Rejected`;
- owned by the caller;
- released with `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError
    OpenPitAccountAdjustmentBatchError;
```

## `OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode`

Machine-readable discriminant describing why building an engine failed.

Each value identifies a distinct failure category. There is no success value: a
build-error object exists only when a build did not produce an engine.

```c
typedef uint8_t OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode;
/**
 * Two or more registered policies declare the same name.
 */
#define OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode_DuplicatePolicyName \
    ((OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode) 0)
/**
 * Two or more registered policies declare the same non-default group id.
 */
#define OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode_DuplicatePolicyGroupId \
    ((OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode) 1)
/**
 * A failure category not covered by the above. Forward-compatible catch-all;
 * no structured payload is available.
 */
#define OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode_Other ((OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode) 2)
```

## `OpenPitEngineBuildError`

Structured build-failure details returned by engine construction.

Ownership:

- created by `openpit_engine_builder_build` when building does not produce an
  engine;
- owned by the caller;
- released with `openpit_destroy_engine_build_error`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitEngineBuildError OpenPitEngineBuildError;
```

## `openpit_create_engine_builder`

Creates a new engine builder with the chosen synchronization policy.

Success:

- returns a non-null caller-owned builder object.

Error:

- returns null when `sync_policy` is not one of `OpenPitSyncPolicy_None` (0),
  `OpenPitSyncPolicy_Full` (1), or `OpenPitSyncPolicy_Account` (2);
- if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString`
  error handle that MUST be released with `openpit_destroy_shared_string`.

Cleanup:

- release the pointer with `openpit_destroy_engine_builder` if you stop before
  building;
- after a successful build the builder is consumed and must still be released
  with `openpit_destroy_engine_builder`.

```c
OpenPitEngineBuilder * openpit_create_engine_builder(
    uint8_t sync_policy,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_engine_builder`

Releases a builder pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- after this call the pointer is invalid;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_engine_builder(
    OpenPitEngineBuilder * builder
);
```

## `openpit_engine_builder_build`

Finalizes a builder and creates an engine.

Success:

- returns a non-null engine pointer.

Error:

- returns null when `builder` is null, the builder was already consumed, or no
  policies were registered;
- for those non-domain failures, if `out_error` is not null, writes a
  caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString` error handle that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_shared_string`; `out_build_error` is left untouched;
- returns null when the configuration is rejected during building (for
  example, duplicate policy names or duplicate group ids); in that case, if
  `out_build_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitEngineBuildError` pointer that carries the machine-readable failure
  code and the offending value, and MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_engine_build_error`; `out_error` is left untouched for this
  domain failure.

Ownership:

- on success the returned engine pointer is owned by the caller and must be
  released with `openpit_destroy_engine`; `out_build_error` is left untouched;
- the builder becomes consumed regardless of success and must not be reused.

```c
OpenPitEngine * openpit_engine_builder_build(
    OpenPitEngineBuilder * builder,
    OpenPitEngineBuildError ** out_build_error,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_engine_build_error`

Releases a build-error object returned by engine construction.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_engine_build_error(
    OpenPitEngineBuildError * build_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_build_error_get_code`

Returns the machine-readable failure category of a build error.

Contract:

- `build_error` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
OpenPitEngineBuildErrorCode openpit_engine_build_error_get_code(
    const OpenPitEngineBuildError * build_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_build_error_get_policy_name`

Returns a non-owning view of the offending policy name from a build error.

Contract:

- `build_error` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- the returned view points into memory owned by `build_error` and is valid
  while `build_error` is alive; it must not be used after the build error is
  destroyed;
- the view is empty unless the failure category is the duplicate-policy-name
  category;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
OpenPitStringView openpit_engine_build_error_get_policy_name(
    const OpenPitEngineBuildError * build_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_build_error_get_policy_group_id`

Returns the offending policy group id from a build error.

Contract:

- `build_error` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- the value is zero unless the failure category is the
  duplicate-policy-group-id category;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
uint16_t openpit_engine_build_error_get_policy_group_id(
    const OpenPitEngineBuildError * build_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_engine`

Releases an engine pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- destroying the engine also releases any state and policies retained by that
  engine instance;
- this function always succeeds.

```c
void openpit_destroy_engine(
    OpenPitEngine * engine
);
```

## `openpit_engine_start_pre_trade`

Starts pre-trade processing and returns a deferred request pointer.

This stage validates whether the order can enter the full pre-trade flow.

Success:

- returns `Passed` when the order passed this stage; read `out_request`;
- returns `Rejected` when the order was rejected; read `out_rejects` if not
  null.

Error:

- returns `Error` when input pointers are invalid or the order payload cannot
  be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Cleanup:

- release a successful request with
  `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute` or
  `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`.

Output ownership contract:

- on `Passed`, a non-null request pointer is written to `out_request` if it is
  not null;
- on `Rejected`, a non-null `OpenPitPretradeRejectList` pointer is written to
  `out_rejects` if it is not null;
- the caller owns either returned object and MUST release it with the
  corresponding destroy function;
- no thread-local state is involved, and returned pointers are safe to read on
  any thread;
- on `Passed` and `Error`, `out_rejects` is left untouched;
- on `Rejected` and `Error`, `out_request` is left untouched.

Order lifetime contract:

- `order` is read as a borrowed view during this call;
- the operation snapshots that payload before returning, because the deferred
  request may outlive the source buffers.

```c
OpenPitPretradeStatus openpit_engine_start_pre_trade(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitOrder * order,
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest ** out_request,
    OpenPitPretradeRejectList ** out_rejects,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_execute_pre_trade`

Runs the complete pre-trade check in one call.

Success:

- returns `Passed` when the order passed this stage; read `out_reservation`;
- returns `Rejected` when the order was rejected is not null; read
  `out_rejects`.

Error:

- returns `Error` when input pointers are invalid or the order payload cannot
  be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Cleanup:

- release a successful reservation with
  `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit`,
  `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_rollback`, or
  `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation`.

Output ownership contract:

- on `Passed`, a non-null reservation pointer is written to `out_reservation`
  if it is not null;
- on `Rejected`, a non-null `OpenPitPretradeRejectList` pointer is written to
  `out_rejects` if it is not null;
- the caller owns either returned object and MUST release it with the
  corresponding destroy function;
- no thread-local state is involved, and returned pointers are safe to read on
  any thread;
- on `Passed` and `Error`, `out_rejects` is left untouched;
- on `Rejected` and `Error`, `out_reservation` is left untouched.

Order lifetime contract:

- `order` is read as a borrowed view during this call only;
- the operation does not retain any pointer into source memory after this
  function returns.

```c
OpenPitPretradeStatus openpit_engine_execute_pre_trade(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitOrder * order,
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation ** out_reservation,
    OpenPitPretradeRejectList ** out_rejects,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute`

Executes a deferred request returned by `openpit_engine_start_pre_trade`.

Success:

- returns `Passed` when the order passed this stage; read `out_reservation`;
- returns `Rejected` when the order was rejected and `out_rejects` is not
  null; read `out_rejects`.

Error:

- returns `Error` when input pointers are invalid or the order payload cannot
  be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Ownership:

- this call consumes the request object's content exactly once;
- after a successful or failed execute, the object itself may still be
  released with `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`, but it cannot be
  executed again.

Output ownership contract:

- on `Passed`, a non-null reservation pointer is written to `out_reservation`
  if it is not null;
- on `Rejected`, a non-null `OpenPitPretradeRejectList` pointer is written to
  `out_rejects` if it is not null;
- the caller owns either returned object and MUST release it with the
  corresponding destroy function;
- no thread-local state is involved, and returned pointers are safe to read on
  any thread;
- on `Passed` and `Error`, `out_rejects` is left untouched;
- on `Rejected` and `Error`, `out_reservation` is left untouched.

```c
OpenPitPretradeStatus openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_request_execute(
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest * request,
    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation ** out_reservation,
    OpenPitPretradeRejectList ** out_rejects,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_request`

Releases a deferred request pointer owned by the caller.

Contract:

- passing null is allowed;
- destroying an unexecuted request abandons it without creating a reservation;
- this function always succeeds.

    OpenPitPretradePreTradeRequest * request
);
```

## `openpit_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation_commit`

);
```

## `openpit_destroy_pretrade_pre_trade_reservation`

    OpenPitPretradePreTradeReservation * reservation
);
```

## `openpit_engine_apply_execution_report`

Applies an execution report to engine state.

Returns `true` on success, `false` on error.

Success:

- returns `true`;
- if `out_blocks` is not null and at least one policy entered a blocked state,
  writes a caller-owned `OpenPitPretradeAccountBlockList` pointer; release it
  with `openpit_pretrade_destroy_account_block_list`;
- when no policy blocked, `out_blocks` is left untouched;
- if `out_adjustments` is not null and at least one policy produced an
  account-adjustment outcome, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentOutcomeList` pointer; release it with
  `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_outcome_list`;
- when no outcome was produced, `out_adjustments` is left untouched.

Error:

- returns `false` when input pointers are invalid or the report payload cannot
  be decoded;
- if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString`
  error handle that MUST be released with `openpit_destroy_shared_string`.

Lifetime contract:

- `report` is read as a borrowed view during this call only;
- the operation does not retain any pointer into source memory after this
  function returns.

## `openpit_engine_apply_account_adjustment`

Applies a batch of account adjustments to one account.

Success:

- returns `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus::Applied` when the batch was
  accepted and applied;
- returns `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus::Rejected` when the call itself
  completed normally but a policy rejected the batch; read `out_reject`.

Error:

- returns `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentApplyStatus::Error` when input pointers are
  invalid or some adjustment payload cannot be decoded;
- on `Error`, if `out_error` is not null, it is filled with a caller-owned
  `OpenPitSharedString` that MUST be destroyed by the caller.

Result handling:

- `Applied` means there is no reject object to clean up;
- on `Applied`, if `out_outcomes` is not null and at least one policy produced
  an account-adjustment outcome, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountAdjustmentOutcomeList` pointer; release it with
  `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_outcome_list`; if no outcome was
  produced, `out_outcomes` is left untouched;
- `Rejected` stores batch error details in `out_reject`, the caller must
  release a returned object with
  `openpit_destroy_account_adjustment_batch_error`;
- rejects returned by `openpit_account_adjustment_batch_error_get_rejects`
  contain string views borrowed from the batch error and must not be used
  after the batch error is destroyed;

    const OpenPitAccountGroupError * err
);
```

## `openpit_account_group_error_get_account`

Returns the offending account identifier from an account-group error.

or returns `false` and leaves `out_group` untouched when no group is set.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- `out_group` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- returns `true` when the account belongs to a group and writes that group to
  `out_group`;

  to only when the return value is `true`;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
bool openpit_account_group_error_get_current_group(
    const OpenPitAccountGroupError * err,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId * out_group
);
```

## `openpit_engine_register_account_group`

Atomically registers every account in `accounts` into `group`.

The operation is all-or-nothing: if any listed account is already a member of
any group (including `group`), no account is registered.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `accounts` must point to an array of at least `accounts_len` account
  identifiers, or may be null when `accounts_len` is zero;
- `group` is the target group and must not be the reserved
  `OPENPIT_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_GROUP`.

Success:

- returns `true`; all listed accounts are now members of `group`.

Error:

- returns `false` when `engine` is null, `accounts` is null with non-zero
  length, `group` is the reserved default group, or any listed account is
  already registered;
- for pointer/argument errors, if `out_error` is not null, writes a
  caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString` error handle that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_shared_string`;
- for domain errors (reserved target group, or account already registered), if
  `out_group_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountGroupError` pointer that MUST be released with

  domain failures.

```c
bool openpit_engine_register_account_group(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitParamAccountId * accounts,
    size_t accounts_len,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId group,
    OpenPitAccountGroupError ** out_group_error,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_unregister_account_group`

of `group`, no account is removed.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `accounts` must point to an array of at least `accounts_len` account
  identifiers, or may be null when `accounts_len` is zero;

  length, `group` is the reserved default group, or any listed account is not
  in `group`;
- for pointer/argument errors, if `out_error` is not null, writes a
  caller-owned `OpenPitSharedString` error handle that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_shared_string`;
- for domain errors (reserved target group, or account not in group), if
  `out_group_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountGroupError` pointer that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_account_group_error`; `out_error` is left untouched for
  domain failures.

```c
bool openpit_engine_unregister_account_group(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    const OpenPitParamAccountId * accounts,
    size_t accounts_len,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId group,
    OpenPitAccountGroupError ** out_group_error,
    OpenPitOutError out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_account_group`

Returns the account-group membership of a single account.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `account` is the account identifier to look up;
- `out_group` must be a valid non-null pointer.

Success:

- returns `true` when the account belongs to a group and writes that group
  identifier to `out_group`;
- returns `false` when the account belongs to no group; `out_group` is not
  written to when the return value is `false`.

Error:

- aborts the call when `engine` or `out_group` is null.

```c
bool openpit_engine_account_group(
    const OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountId account,

Ownership:

- created by `openpit_engine_replace_account_block_reason`,
  `openpit_engine_block_account_group`,
  `openpit_engine_unblock_account_group`, and
  `openpit_engine_replace_account_group_block_reason` on failure;
- owned by the caller;
- released with `openpit_destroy_account_block_error`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitAccountBlockError OpenPitAccountBlockError;
```

## `OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind`

Discriminant for the variant carried by an [`OpenPitAccountBlockError`].

```c
typedef uint32_t OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind;
/**
 * The target group is the reserved default account group.
 */
#define OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_ReservedGroup \
    ((OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind) 0)
/**
 * The target account is not currently blocked.
 */
#define OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_AccountNotBlocked \
    ((OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind) 1)
/**
 * The target account group is not currently blocked.
 */
#define OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_GroupNotBlocked \
    ((OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind) 2)
```

## `openpit_destroy_account_block_error`

Releases a caller-owned account-block error.

Contract:

- call exactly once per pointer returned by a block function;
- passing null is allowed and has no effect.

```c
void openpit_destroy_account_block_error(
    OpenPitAccountBlockError * err
);
```

## `openpit_account_block_error_get_message`

Returns the human-readable error message from an account-block error.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- the returned view borrows from the error object and is valid while the error
  is alive;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
OpenPitStringView openpit_account_block_error_get_message(
    const OpenPitAccountBlockError * err
);
```

## `openpit_account_block_error_get_kind`

Returns the variant kind of an account-block error.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind openpit_account_block_error_get_kind(
    const OpenPitAccountBlockError * err
);
```

## `openpit_account_block_error_get_account`

Returns the offending account identifier from an account-block error.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- `out_account` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- returns `true` when the error variant carries an account and writes it to
  `out_account`;
- returns `false` when no account is present; `out_account` is left untouched
  when the return value is `false`;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
bool openpit_account_block_error_get_account(
    const OpenPitAccountBlockError * err,
    OpenPitParamAccountId * out_account
);
```

## `openpit_account_block_error_get_group`

Returns the offending account-group identifier from an account-block error.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- `out_group` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- returns `true` when the error variant carries a group and writes it to
  `out_group`;
- returns `false` when no group is present; `out_group` is left untouched when
  the return value is `false`;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
bool openpit_account_block_error_get_group(
    const OpenPitAccountBlockError * err,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId * out_group
);
```

## `OpenPitConfigureErrorKind`

Discriminant for the variant carried by an [`OpenPitConfigureError`].

```c
typedef uint32_t OpenPitConfigureErrorKind;
/**
 * No configurable policy carries the requested name.
 */
#define OpenPitConfigureErrorKind_Unknown ((OpenPitConfigureErrorKind) 0)
/**
 * A policy is registered under the name, but its settings type differs from
 * the one the called configure function targets.
 */
#define OpenPitConfigureErrorKind_TypeMismatch ((OpenPitConfigureErrorKind) 1)
/**
 * The applied update was rejected by the policy's settings validation; the
 * prior configuration still applies.
 */
#define OpenPitConfigureErrorKind_Validation ((OpenPitConfigureErrorKind) 2)
```

## `OpenPitConfigureError`

Structured error returned by runtime policy reconfiguration.

Ownership:

- created by the `openpit_engine_configure_*` functions on failure;
- owned by the caller;
- released with `openpit_destroy_configure_error`.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitConfigureError OpenPitConfigureError;
```

## `openpit_destroy_configure_error`

Releases a caller-owned configure error.

Contract:

- call exactly once per pointer returned by an `openpit_engine_configure_*`
  function;
- passing null is allowed and has no effect.

```c
void openpit_destroy_configure_error(
    OpenPitConfigureError * err
);
```

## `openpit_configure_error_get_message`

Returns the human-readable error message from a configure error.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- the returned view borrows from the error object and is valid while the error
  is alive;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
OpenPitStringView openpit_configure_error_get_message(
    const OpenPitConfigureError * err
);
```

## `openpit_configure_error_get_kind`

Returns the variant kind of a configure error.

Contract:

- `err` must be a valid non-null pointer;
- this function never fails;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
OpenPitConfigureErrorKind openpit_configure_error_get_kind(
    const OpenPitConfigureError * err
);
```

## `openpit_engine_block_account`

Blocks `account` with `reason`.

The first cause for an account wins: if the account is already blocked (by an
admin call or a prior kill-switch), this call is a no-op and does not overwrite
the stored reason. Use `openpit_engine_replace_account_block_reason` to change
the stored reason.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `reason` is interpreted as UTF-8; an empty string is used when `reason.ptr`
  is null OR `reason.len` is zero; passing a null `ptr` with a non-zero `len`
  is caller misuse and is treated as empty (not read); an empty reason is
  explicitly allowed;
- violating the `engine` pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
void openpit_engine_block_account(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountId account_id,
    OpenPitStringView reason
);
```

## `openpit_engine_unblock_account`

Unblocks `account`, clearing any block on it.

Idempotent: a no-op when `account` is not blocked. Both admin blocks and
kill-switch blocks are cleared.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- violating the pointer contract aborts the call.

```c
void openpit_engine_unblock_account(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountId account_id
);
```

## `openpit_engine_replace_account_block_reason`

Replaces the stored reason of an already-blocked account.

Unlike `openpit_engine_block_account`, which preserves the first cause, this
overwrites the stored cause with `reason`, leaving the account blocked.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `reason` is interpreted as UTF-8; an empty string is used when `reason.ptr`
  is null OR `reason.len` is zero; passing a null `ptr` with a non-zero `len`
  is caller misuse and is treated as empty (not read); an empty reason is
  explicitly allowed;
- on failure, if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountBlockError` pointer that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_account_block_error`;
- aborts the call when `engine` is null.

Success:

- returns `true`; the stored reason has been replaced.

Error:

- returns `false` with `OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_AccountNotBlocked` when
  `account` is not currently blocked.

```c
bool openpit_engine_replace_account_block_reason(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountId account_id,
    OpenPitStringView reason,
    OpenPitAccountBlockError ** out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_block_account_group`

Blocks the account group `group` with `reason`.

The first cause for a group wins: re-blocking an already-blocked group is a
no-op. Use `openpit_engine_replace_account_group_block_reason` to change the
stored reason.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `group` must not be `OPENPIT_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_GROUP`;
- `reason` is interpreted as UTF-8; an empty string is used when `reason.ptr`
  is null OR `reason.len` is zero; passing a null `ptr` with a non-zero `len`
  is caller misuse and is treated as empty (not read); an empty reason is
  explicitly allowed;
- on failure, if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountBlockError` pointer that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_account_block_error`;
- aborts the call when `engine` is null.

Success:

- returns `true`; the group is now blocked.

Error:

- returns `false` with `OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_ReservedGroup` when
  `group` is the reserved default group.

```c
bool openpit_engine_block_account_group(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId group,
    OpenPitStringView reason,
    OpenPitAccountBlockError ** out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_unblock_account_group`

Unblocks the account group `group`, clearing the group block.

Idempotent: a no-op when `group` is not blocked. Accounts blocked individually
remain blocked.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `group` must not be `OPENPIT_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_GROUP`;
- on failure, if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountBlockError` pointer that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_account_block_error`;
- aborts the call when `engine` is null.

Success:

- returns `true`; the group is now unblocked.

Error:

- returns `false` with `OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_ReservedGroup` when
  `group` is the reserved default group.

```c
bool openpit_engine_unblock_account_group(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId group,
    OpenPitAccountBlockError ** out_error
);
```

## `openpit_engine_replace_account_group_block_reason`

Replaces the stored reason of an already-blocked account group.

Unlike `openpit_engine_block_account_group`, which preserves the first cause,
this overwrites the stored cause with `reason`, leaving the group blocked.

Contract:

- `engine` must be a valid non-null engine pointer;
- `group` must not be `OPENPIT_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_GROUP`;
- `reason` is interpreted as UTF-8; an empty string is used when `reason.ptr`
  is null OR `reason.len` is zero; passing a null `ptr` with a non-zero `len`
  is caller misuse and is treated as empty (not read); an empty reason is
  explicitly allowed;
- on failure, if `out_error` is not null, writes a caller-owned
  `OpenPitAccountBlockError` pointer that MUST be released with
  `openpit_destroy_account_block_error`;
- aborts the call when `engine` is null.

Success:

- returns `true`; the stored group-block reason has been replaced.

Error:

- returns `false` with `OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_ReservedGroup` when
  `group` is the reserved default group;
- returns `false` with `OpenPitAccountBlockErrorKind_GroupNotBlocked` when
  `group` is not currently blocked.

```c
bool openpit_engine_replace_account_group_block_reason(
    OpenPitEngine * engine,
    OpenPitParamAccountGroupId group,
    OpenPitStringView reason,
    OpenPitAccountBlockError ** out_error
);
```

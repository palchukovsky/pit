## `OpenPitStringView`

Non-owning UTF-8 string view.

This type never owns memory. It borrows bytes from another object.

Lifetime contract:

- `ptr` points to `len` readable bytes;
- the memory is valid while the original object is alive and the source string
  has not been modified;
- the caller must not free or mutate memory behind `ptr`.
- if the caller needs to retain the string beyond that announced lifetime, the
  caller must copy the bytes.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitStringView {
    const uint8_t * ptr;
    size_t len;
} OpenPitStringView;
```

## `OpenPitSharedString`

Owning shared-string handle.

Use this type when an FFI function needs to hand a string to the caller whose
lifetime must extend beyond the single FFI call and whose storage must not
depend on thread-local state remaining intact on the reader side.

Ownership contract:

- every non-null `*mut OpenPitSharedString` returned through FFI is owned by
  the caller;
- the caller MUST release it with `openpit_destroy_shared_string` when no
  longer needed; failing to do so leaks the underlying allocation;
- the handle internally holds a reference-counted copy of the string, so
  multiple live handles pointing at the same original value are safe and
  independent; destroying one handle does not affect the others.

Read contract:

- read the bytes with `openpit_shared_string_view`;
- the returned `OpenPitStringView` is valid while this specific handle is
  alive and must not outlive the call to `openpit_destroy_shared_string` for
  this handle.

Threading contract:

- the handle itself is safe to move to and read from any thread once the
  caller has received it; no thread-local state is consulted when reading or
  destroying.

```c
typedef struct OpenPitSharedString OpenPitSharedString;
```

## `openpit_destroy_shared_string`

Releases a `OpenPitSharedString` handle.

Null input is a no-op.

After this call, the handle and any `OpenPitStringView` previously obtained from
it are invalid and must not be used.

```c
void openpit_destroy_shared_string(
    OpenPitSharedString * handle
);
```

## `openpit_shared_string_view`

Borrows a read-only view of the bytes stored in the handle.

Returns an unset view (`ptr == null`, `len == 0`) when `handle` is null.

The returned view is valid only while `handle` remains alive. The caller must
copy the bytes if they must outlive the handle.

```c
OpenPitStringView openpit_shared_string_view(
    const OpenPitSharedString * handle
);
```

# Examples

Runnable end-to-end examples that integrate the OpenPit SDK from each binding,
plus the scenario tables they share. Each example has its own README with the
full story; this page is the index and the one-command entry points.

## Layout

- `python/` — Python examples (`rate_pnl_killswitch`, `spot_funds`,
  `spot_table`).
- `go/` — the same examples for the Go binding.
- `cpp/` — the same examples for the C++ binding.
- `tables/` — scenario tables consumed by the `spot_table` examples
  (see [`tables/spot/README.md`](tables/spot/README.md)).

## How to run

From the repository root, run every example against local sources:

```sh
just run-examples          # every language
just run-examples-python   # Python only
just run-examples-go       # Go only
just run-examples-cpp      # C++ only
```

To run a single example standalone (against the published package), see its
own README, e.g. [`python/spot_funds`](python/spot_funds/README.md) or
[`cpp/spot_funds`](cpp/spot_funds/README.md).

## How to run unit tests

Each example ships a smoke test, included in the per-language suites:

```sh
just test-python         # Python examples' tests (plus the binding tests)
just test-go             # Go examples' tests (plus the binding tests)
just test-examples-cpp   # build the C++ examples and run their smoke tests
```

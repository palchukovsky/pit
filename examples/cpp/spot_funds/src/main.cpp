// Example spot_funds is the smallest end-to-end integration of OpenPit's
// built-in SpotFunds pre-trade policy: it shows how a buy order reserves
// settlement cash, how a second order is rejected because that cash is still
// held, and how a fill settles the held reservation.
//
// What is illustrated:
//
//   - building a limit-only engine with SpotFunds + OrderValidation
//   - seeding an account's available cash via ApplyAccountAdjustment
//   - the reservation mechanic: a committed BUY holds settlement funds, so a
//     follow-up BUY that needs the same cash is rejected with InsufficientFunds
//   - tying a fill back to its reservation by carrying the pre-trade lock on
//     the execution report, so SpotFunds settles the right held amount
//
// Audience: an integrator who wants to lift the SpotFunds call pattern into
// their own order/fill pipeline.
//
// What you typically change to adapt this example to your own application:
//
//  1. Engine policies - see BuildEngine() in spot_funds.hpp.
//  2. The seed balance and the orders - here they are hard-coded constants
//     chosen so the reservation mechanic is the lesson; your system feeds
//     real account state and strategy orders.
//  3. The print statements - replace them with your order-router and
//     fill-handler side effects.
//
// The example is deliberately flat: RunExample() reads top-to-bottom as a
// story, and every engine call is factored into a small named helper (in
// spot_funds.hpp) that the smoke test reuses. This is the C++ mirror of the Go
// example at examples/go/spot_funds/main.go.

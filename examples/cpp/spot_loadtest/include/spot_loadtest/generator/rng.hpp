// The Go harness uses math/rand/v2's PCG so the same seed yields the same
// stream (the basis of its determinism guarantee). This C++ port keeps the same
// property: a self-contained PCG64 (the canonical algorithm with a fixed bit
// layout) drives every draw, consumed in a fixed order, so the emitted stream
// and every prediction are reproducible for a given (seed, config). The exact
// numeric stream is not byte-identical to Go's — that is impossible across
// languages — but the determinism and convergence invariants the harness relies
// on hold within this binding.
